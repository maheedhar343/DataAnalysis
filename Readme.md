# Data Analysis Project: Sales Data Exploration with Python

Welcome to my first data analysis project! This project is part of my journey to learn **data analysis** and **data science** using Python. I’ve built a simple pipeline to analyze sales data, and I’m excited to share it with you. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced coder, this project is designed to be easy to understand and replicate.

This project processes a dataset of product sales (like a store’s transaction records) and takes you through five key steps of data analysis. Think of it like baking a cake: you gather ingredients, clean them, mix them properly, check the flavor, and finally serve it! Below, I explain each step in a way that even someone new to Python can follow.

## What Does This Project Do?

This project analyzes a dataset (`sales_data.csv`) containing sales records with details like product names, prices, quantities, and regions. It:
1. Loads the data (like opening a recipe book).
2. Cleans it (like washing vegetables).
3. Organizes it (like chopping ingredients neatly).
4. Explores patterns (like tasting the batter).
5. Builds a model to predict sales (like baking the final cake).

The output is a Word document (`Data_Analysis_Report.docx`) summarizing the findings, along with visualizations (charts) to show trends.

## The Five Steps Explained (In Simple Terms)

### Step 1: Data Extraction
**What is it?** This is like picking up a notebook filled with sales records from a store. We load the data from a CSV file (`sales_data.csv`) into Python so we can work with it.

**Example**: Imagine you have a list of your favorite snacks written in a notebook. You open the notebook to read it—that’s data extraction!

**In the Code**: We use a Python library called `pandas` to read the CSV file and display the first few rows to make sure it loaded correctly.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
**What is it?** Data can be messy, like a room with scattered toys. Cleaning means removing errors, like duplicate entries (e.g., the same sale listed twice) or fixing missing values.

**Example**: If your snack list accidentally lists "Chips" twice, you cross out the extra one. That’s cleaning!

**In the Code**: We check for missing values and remove duplicates using `pandas`. For our dataset, there were no errors, but we still check to be safe.

### Step 3: Data Wrangling
**What is it?** This is like organizing your ingredients before cooking. We reshape the data to make it easier to analyze, like creating a new column for total sales (price × quantity) or converting categories (e.g., "Electronics" or "Furniture") into numbers that a computer can understand.

**Example**: If your snack list has categories like "Sweet" or "Salty," you might assign numbers (e.g., 1 for Sweet, 0 for Salty) to make it easier to sort. That’s wrangling!

**In the Code**: We create a `TotalSales` column, convert the `Date` column to a proper date format, and use a technique called "one-hot encoding" to turn categories into numbers.

### Step 4: Data Analysis
**What is it?** This is where we explore the data to find interesting patterns, like figuring out which products sell the most. We use charts to visualize trends, making it easier to understand.

**Example**: Imagine you count how many sweet vs. salty snacks you ate this month and draw a bar chart to see which one wins. That’s analysis!

**In the Code**: We use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create three charts:
- A **correlation matrix** to see how variables (like price and quantity) relate.
- A **bar chart** showing total sales by product.
- A **line chart** showing sales over time.

These charts are saved as PNG files for the final report.

### Step 5: Action (Modeling)
**What is it?** This is the exciting part where we use the data to make predictions, like guessing how much a product will sell based on its price and quantity. We build a simple machine learning model to do this.

**Example**: If you notice that buying more snacks leads to eating more, you might predict how many you’ll eat next week based on how many you buy. That’s modeling!

**In the Code**: We use a `LinearRegression` model from `scikit-learn` to predict `TotalSales`. The model learns patterns from the data and gives us a score (R²) to tell us how good it is. Finally, we create a Word document summarizing everything, including the charts and model results.

### Instructions to Set Up Your GitHub Repository

To post this project on GitHub and make it look professional, follow these steps:

**Prepare Your Project Files**:
   - Ensure you have the following files in your project folder (from our previous discussions):
     - `sales_data.csv` (sample dataset).
     - `data_preprocessing.py` (Steps 1-3).
     - `data_analysis.py` (Step 4, updated version).
     - `data_modeling.py` (Step 5, updated version).
     - `run_all.py` (automation script).
   - Create a new file named `README.md` and copy-paste the content above.
   - Replace `[Your Name]` in the `README.md` with your actual name or GitHub username.
   - Optionally, include the generated output files (`sales_data_wrangled.csv`, PNG charts, `Data_Analysis_Report.docx`) to show results, but avoid committing large files unless necessary.
